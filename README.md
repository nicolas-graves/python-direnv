# python-direnv

Python-direnv executes a [direnv](https://direnv.net) `.envrc` file
and sets its environment variables. It helps in the development of
applications following the [12-factor](https://12factor.net/)
principles. This package implements the same public API as
[python-dotenv](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv).

Contrary to most [related python projects](#related-projects),
python-direnv will not read key-value pairs, but actually load then
extract them from a bash subshell.

This unlocks the full functionality of bash, but comes with a price
(vulnerability to [shell
injection](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#security-considerations)). This
risk is mitigated using `direnv`'s database : if a `.envrc` file has
not been allowed to execute with `direnv allow`, the subshell will not
be executed and will yield a `PermissionError`. You are responsible
for what you execute.

In cases you can avoid that risk, it is recommended to use a safer
approach, see [related projects](#related-projects).

## Getting Started

(This package is not yet uploaded to pypi.org, but you can install it from source).
```shell
pip install python-direnv
```

If your application takes its configuration from environment variables, like a 12-factor
application, launching it in development is not very practical because you have to set
those environment variables yourself.

To help you with that, you can add Python-direnv to your application to make it load the
configuration from a `.envrc` file when it is present (e.g. in development) while remaining
configurable via the environment:

```python
from direnv import load_direnv

load_direnv()  # take environment variables

# Code of your application, which uses environment variables (e.g. from `os.environ` or
# `os.getenv`) as if they came from the actual environment.
```

By default, `load_direnv` doesn't override existing environment variables and looks for a `.envrc` file in same directory as python script or searches for it incrementally higher up.

To configure the development environment, add a bash file named `.envrc` in the root directory of your
project:

```
.
├── .envrc
└── foo.py
```

You will probably want to add `.envrc` to your `.gitignore`, especially if it contains
secrets like a password.

See the section "File format" below for more information about what you can write in a
`.envrc` file.

## Other Use Cases

### Load configuration without altering the environment

The function `direnv_values` works more or less the same way as `load_direnv`, except it
doesn't touch the environment, it just returns a `dict` with the values parsed from the
`.envrc` file.

```python
from direnv import direnv_values

config = direnv_values(".envrc")
```

This notably enables advanced configuration management:

```python
import os
from direnv import direnv_values

config = {
    **direnv_values(".env.shared"),  # load shared development variables
    **direnv_values(".env.secret"),  # load sensitive variables
    **os.environ,  # override loaded values with environment variables
}
```

### Load .envrc files in IPython

You can use direnv in IPython.  By default, it will use `find_direnv` to search for a
`.envrc` file:

```python
%load_ext direnv
%direnv
```

You can also specify a path:

```python
%direnv relative/or/absolute/path/to/.envrc
```

Optional flags:

- `-o` to override existing variables.
- `-v` for increased verbosity.

## Differences with python-dotenv

### Streams

Contrary to `python-dotenv`, this package doesn't implement
[streams][python_streams] via the `stream` argument of `load_direnv`
and `direnv_values`. This behaviour is unsafe with bash subshells and
doesn't allow to check if you have allowed the file to be
executed. The argument still exists to maintain the API, but will
return a `NotImplementedError`.

### Command-line interface

No command-line interface is implemented.

### Arguments and variable expansion

This package currently doesn't support neither `interpolate` nor
`encoding` arguments, because the file is read with `source` and
variables are expanded by default with `source`.

Beware, variable expansion is not working in the same way as in
python-dotenv, but as standard bash. This is mainly what you would
expect :

With `load_direnv(override=True)` or `direnv_values()`, the value of a variable is the
first of the values defined in the following list:

- Value of that variable in the `.envrc` file.
- Value of that variable in the environment.
- Default value, if provided.
- Empty string.

With `load_direnv(override=False)`, the value of a variable is the first of the values
defined in the following list:

- Value of that variable in the environment.
- Value of that variable in the `.envrc` file.
- Default value, if provided.
- Empty string.

There's however a diverging behaviour when using POSIX expansion on an
existing variable, see the test
`test_load_direnv_redefine_var_used_in_file_no_override` for more
information. This will probably continue to diverge, as I think this
version makes more sense.

### direnv-values

The function `direnv-values` doesn't record environment variables if
they are set to the same return value than in the current
environment. This is because the dict is constructed from a diff
between starting and finishing environment in the bash subshell.

This might matter if you extract some values with direnv-values, but
plan to apply them in another environment.

## Development

This package is essentially implemented. I want to add proper parsing
and use of the [direnv configuration
file](https://direnv.net/man/direnv.toml.1.html). I only use one class
and one function from the `python-dotenv` dependency so I might copy
them instead of depend on them. PRs are welcome.

There are a [lot of options under
bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/The-Set-Builtin.html)
that we could implement to add more options for parsing the file, that
might be useful for some.

This project is licensed under GPLv3 because it's easy for someone to
create and share an unsafe version. To prevent that, I want to ensure
that anyone who modifies the project is required to be open about
their changes and explain them clearly.
